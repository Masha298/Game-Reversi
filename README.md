## About

The game uses a square board measuring 8 Ã— 8 cells and 64 special chips, painted white and black from different sides.
The player must place a chip in such a way that there is a continuous row of opponent's chips between this placed chip and one of the chips already on the board of his color. 
All the opponent's chips included in the "closed" row change color on this turn.
